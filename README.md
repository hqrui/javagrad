Java clone of [karpathy/micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) made without referring to the original after watching his [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0).\
I wrote this to learn Java and to get a better understanding of this basic way of implementing backpropagation. \
I test it on a toy problem, determining whether points on the x-y plane are inside a certain ellipse, and it achieves 98% accuracy on the test set.
